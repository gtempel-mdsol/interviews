Just some questions that might be useful to ask at the start of an interview.



For recent graduates or those with little professional experience:

* most challenging CS course, and why?

* favorite CS course and why?

* CS electives they chose, and why?



For anyone:

* favorite language? explain?


* classes vs modules
looking for notion of objects and inheritance vs interfaces, namespaces, mixins, etc


* describe differences in function calling vs message passing?



* self vs static vs this 
Differs among languages, basically seeing if they understand instance vs something else


* explain difference between constructor vs initializer?
Constructors allocate, initializers operate on ready-to-use objects
